# Container scaling experiment

# Here is the scenario to collect this data. 
# 1) Start one firewall with replication controller (RC)
# 2) Generate firewall load by sending client messages 
# 3) Monitoring module resizes RC when 60% RAM threshold is reached
# 4) Second firewall is created and monitoring module resizes when this one reached the RAM threshold

# All data is collected by running following client command
# ./echoclient --dst=198.162.52.217:3333 --freq=1000 --total=1000000 --inc=10 --threads=4

# container name, timestamp, RAM use percentage
